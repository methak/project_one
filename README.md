# JAMList
### by Team Jam

## Overview & User Stories
- JAMList is an app to help users create and manage shopping lists by store.
- The user decides what store they are going to, or enters store information if not listed.
- Once in a "store", add items to the shopping list.
- Once all items have been added, you can print a grocery list by category for each store.

## Future Work
* Create ability to host separate users using environmental variables and bcrypt
* Track previously shopped items
* Upload an image of a receipt after a shopping trip, and store it with the shopping instance.
* Incorporate APIs from Apple or Google Maps. When a user sets up a new Store, display it on a map. When a user is at their shopping list, add a button to get directions to the store.
